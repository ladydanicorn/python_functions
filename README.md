1. The Calculator App
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Task 1: Create functions for each arithmetic operation.

Task 2: Use inputs to ask the user what operation they want to perform, and what numbers they want to use.

Task 3: Ensure your code can handle division by zero and other potential errors. So if you divide by 0, there is error handling set up to prevent an error from showing in the console.

2. The Shopping List Maker
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to create a program that helps users make a shopping list.

Task 1: Write a function that lets the user add items to a list.

Task 2: Include a function to remove items from the list.

Task 3: Add a function that prints out the entire list in a formatted way.

Note: The goal of this is to be a program. The recommendation is to use a while loop that will allow the user to continue to add, remove, and print off their shopping list until they decide to "quit", also known as breaking the loop.
